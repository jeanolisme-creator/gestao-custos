-- Insert admin user with specific credentials
-- Note: This is for development/demo purposes only
-- In production, passwords should be hashed properly by Supabase Auth

-- The user will need to be created through the Supabase Auth system
-- This is just a reference for the admin credentials:
-- Email: custos@educacao.riopreto.sp.gov.br
-- Password: custos2025@

-- Create a profiles table entry for the admin user (assuming they will sign up)
-- This migration serves as documentation for the admin credentials
